Goodbye 2018!

## Partner For Life
I've finally proposed to my girlfriend after 6 years last November. Yes, that is one of the reasons why I've just started blogging again.
It is one of those important decisions in life and I'm glad I've done it.

Now off to the wedding plans, not that we've just started doing it, it's just that this time we're on a more serious and detailed level.

What do I feel right now? Scared and excited. 
Scared because well i havent done this before, and excited because I'm eager to proceed to this next chapter in my life. 
Which is to be officially be part of someone else's. To me that is always a good thing. 

I'm glad I found her.

## Toys
I haven't bought anything for me these past holidays and I've been wanting to spend some dough. 
Not *that* kind of dough just a couple of bucks for this set of uhh.. toys.

I have this One Piece Luffy - Grandista - The Grandline Men figure, displayed on my PC at home.
Yes, I'm a fan of One Piece. I've bought this because I love Luffy's smile. It is like it's telling me to never give up. Positivity all the way.

Anyway a friend of mine wants to buy a toy in Japan, and I volunteered to buy for him so that I could also buy something for me and then we could share 
the shipping fee.

Been deciding on pulling the trigger on that DragonBall Super Goku - Grandista - Resoulution of Soldiers (Special Color) which has a really cool color way.
I'd buy it for the aesthetics, it looks like a designer toy.  
Or the Kid Naruto from the same line which also has the positive smile I've always been wanting.

## To 2019!
And just like that 2018 was done. I'm satisfied with my 2018.
2019, I hope you bring me the time to actually put on posts for this blog/site. :)

Thank you for reading, that is all OR as Gabe from the offices says.. "Ciao"
