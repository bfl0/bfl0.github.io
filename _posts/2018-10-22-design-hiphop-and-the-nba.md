Aaaaand we're back. After a long time, a few weeks, a month? a couple? Anyway, I'm here I'm back. 

Finally had the time to write one up. This is me writing this blog while the song Better by Khalid is playing in the background.

## April's
A coleague ask for my help to design her budding business a logo.
Its a very simple logo, she gave me some inspirations to work on. I, being excited as hell, worked on it.

Here are some of the designs I gave her.

And this is the final design. I'm hoping there wont be anymore changes as I'm quite happy with it. Really wish she shares the same sentiment.

## This time in Hiphop
![WEFUCKINGATE](https://i.postimg.cc/cHQF98ws/album.png)

2018 in hiphop is historical. Albums from legends started pouring this year. 
Nas dropped a 7-song album by G.O.O.D. Music. Well multiple artists from the label got their 7 song.
Kanye dropped Ye, Pusha T with DAYTONA, Kanye and Kudi(maaan) with Kids See Ghosts. Then there Taeyana Taylor the come up for the same label.

Eminem dropped an album, Kamikazee which compared to his past albums, Kamikazee was the REVIVAL everyone seems to agree. This also the time some beef'd with him. Have a listen to the song Kill Shot.

Drake, dropped Scoprion, Travis Scott dropped his well waited album Astroworld. Probably the most hyped up album if it weren't for Lil Wayne's Carter V which dropped this same fucking year. 

Other 2018 Albums (those I fuck with):

|Artist          |Album|
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|J Cole          |**KOD**         |
|T.I.          |**Dime Trap**         |
|Nicki Minaj       |**Queen**         |
|LOGIC          |**YSIV**         |
|Denzel Curry          |**TABOO\|TA13OO**         |
|XXXTentacion       |**?**         |

Shoutout to Migos, Sheck Wes, Brockhampton, Cardi, Rae Sremmurd and a whole lot more. 

Before 2018 calls it a wrap, we still have 2 months left.

## BASKETBALL SEASON
NBA is also back, baby. Dwight is now with the Wizards, they haven't won yet(0-2). He still isn't playing though has some "Ass Pain".

Last game they lost to a Raptors without Kawhi at home. lmao

Also since Lebron now is in a purple and gold jersey, they also haven't won shit. 0-2 after a scuffle with the Rockets team. Yep! saliva were spat and punches were thrown.

I'm glad the Fantasy League's I joined last year also started this year. Got me AD, Gobert on the first one and Jokick and CP3 on the other.

Just last game jokic got 35pts, 11-11GF, 12reb, 11ast, 4stl, 1blk and 0TO. If that is not a fantasy god statline, I don't know what is.
