After the creation of the site. I was really eager to post something everyday.
But I have no workflow for creating posts yet.

Right now, i'll just write something in an MD helper/generator somewhere in the net and then add directly in the github repo.
And now that I am writing a blog post, it got me thinking. 

## What am I gonna write? 

![I'm sorry. I promise to lessen these Office Quotes throughout the blog posts.](https://i.postimg.cc/bY1DHPCk/sometimes.png)

Ok, to be honest, I'm just typing this secretly as I'm in a company coding event. I came in early, as the call time is 8:30am. 
It is now 9:04am and people are still comming in and grabbing a seat. 

No speaker yet so people are either checking  their phones or just staring blankly at a repeating video clip. It starts to get annoying lmao.

anyway, all I want to say is I don't have the time right now to fully create a useful blog post.
I promise to write that this coming weekend. :)

### Modern Day Spartans
Early morning commute to Makati is ardous. Gotta respect the people that grind that early everyday.
