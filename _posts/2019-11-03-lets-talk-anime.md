So for a couple of months I didn't update, I've spent some time watching anime. This post will be a mini review for a few of them.

First of...

## Jojo's Bizaare Adventure.

Probably one of the most meme'd anime of all time. It started on a typical super powered human themes in the first season and slowly change to still super powered humans but now with super powered spirit(stands) beside them. The story differs from what the first couple of seasons the most because that time there were no stands. Overall I liked it. Hirohiko Araki, the author, was very forward with the character designs. It was so forward GUCCI collaborated with him on a collection. Crazy.

## Dragonball Broly (Movie)

This film took me back to my childhood. I know they went back with the way they draw the film and it really payed off. Perfect blend of old and new schools. Now, Broly has a decent backstory. And the way the fight scenes were orchastrated was sublime. If there will be another movie like this for DragonBall, you'd bet I'll watch it in the big screen.

## Mob Pysho 100

My god, I never thought ONE, the author of One Punch Man has another amazing Manga/Anime in him.

Mob Psycho is about a student who has psychic abilities. Mob a very naive, shy-type kind of dude went out of his way to ask a "spritual expert" Reigen, a genuinely good *wink wink* con man, about his powers. Which lead Reigen using/partnering with Mob to solve client psychic concerns. From exorsing evil sprits to fighting other psyhics, Mob Psycho 100 will have you laughing on the floor, crying uncontrollably and then have you feeling so enamoured. 

Also Gray by Sajou No Hana, on of their OST, is a fucking emotional trip.
