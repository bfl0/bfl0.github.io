One of the reasons I created this blog was to help me learn about new things. How? well writing about the stuff you learn helps familiarity with the concept.

I believe you can learn better if you can teach the things you've learned.
This will be the first of the many of educational posts that I will be making.

And for our first topic...

## SOLID Programming Principles

![SNAKE!? SNAKE!!!? SNAAAAKEEEEEE!!!](https://i.postimg.cc/1f67yGw1/solid.png){: .center-image }

After the celebration of a newly created software, developers often find themselves pushed on the spot when its time to maintain code. One of the most underrated aspects of develpoment is the maintenance stage. Often times, programmers make their code hastly they forgot other people should read or use them in the future.

The SOLID programming principles were made to guide devs into making better designed software.
SOLID is the abbreviation of 5 principles which are Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segragation and Dependency Inversion. 
This post will serve as a brief overview of each principle.


## Single Responsibility 

![What is my purpose?](https://i.postimg.cc/LhJ0bKsX/purpose.png){: .center-image }

Short for SRP, dictates that a class, method or function should have only one responsibility that pertains to the system functions as a whole. The way I understand this is that classes should be made with a single reason, if you think, "I'll create a method that encrypts this password." that's good. But if you added an "and" like "I'll create a method that encrypts and validates this password." that is a big no. Since adding layers on a single task will also give additional complexity, not to mention more tests whenever you maintain the created method. 

## Open/Closed

This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but not for modification.
Simply put, a method that creates a file with a standard file name. Now if a change is needed wherein a new standard for names should be used. 
The method should have a parameter that takes in the new standard file name. 

## Liskov Substitution 

![Substitution, GSW.](https://i.postimg.cc/sXtmKnLP/liskov.png){: .center-image }

LSP states that a subclass should be created knowing it can replace its superclass. Violating this rule will make your code scattered with lots of extra conditioning.
An obvious rule violation can be had if a list of Foo objects are in a for each loop checking if this Foo is really a subclass of Bar.

This principle was first mentioned by Barbara Liskov during one of her ealier conferences.

## Interface Segragation

Similar to most of the other principles, Interface Segragation's purpose is to reduce maintenance cost of the software code. This is done by dividing the software into single independent parts.
One example is if an interface has two implementing class and one of them was forced to use a blank method(only the other class needs it). The solution is to further separate the interface into their own.
Modification of the code will in turn make it independent of the other class. 

Say no to bloated interfaces. 


## Dependency Inversion

![IDK... they're friends i guess](https://i.postimg.cc/BPPYLDzD/depend.png){: .center-image }

Final principle is the Dependency Inversion.

Abstraction is the most definite explanation of this principle. Simply put, high level modules should not be affected that much by changes in the low level modules.
The code should have a proper abstraction to minimize dependency on both of them.
