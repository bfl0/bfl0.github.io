 I'm Bon Jovi Flores a Java/Web Developer from Manila.

 Currently working as a Java Engineer in one of the largest financial software companies in the world. 
 I do graphics design in my down time, aside from playing computer games, listening to music, watching films and travelling. 

 This blog serves as a medium to share my thoughts on the things I love doing.
